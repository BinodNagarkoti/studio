// This file is a placeholder for any future application-wide static constants.
// It previously held ALL_NEPSE_SYMBOLS and ALL_BROKERS when they were static.
// Now, dynamic data fetching is preferred for such lists.

// Example of a constant that might be added in the future:
// export const SOME_APP_SETTING = "some_value";

// For now, it remains empty or can be removed if no constants are envisioned soon.
// Keeping it allows for an easy place to add constants later without file creation.
